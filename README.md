# EDA-Titanic-Dataset
Exploratory Data Analysis on the Titanic dataset using Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn). Includes data cleaning, visualization, and insights on survival patterns by age, gender, class, and fare. A foundational project for understanding EDA and data-driven storytelling.
# 🛳️ Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## 📘 Overview
This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the classic **Titanic dataset** to uncover insights about passenger survival patterns based on features like age, gender, passenger class, and fare.  
It focuses on data cleaning, visualization, and identifying key trends using Python.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Clean and preprocess raw data for analysis  
- Explore relationships between passenger attributes and survival  
- Visualize distributions and correlations  
- Derive insights that can support predictive modeling

## 🧠 Key Insights
- Females and children had higher survival rates  
- Passengers in higher classes survived more often  
- Fare and embarkation port influenced survival probability  
- Family size affected survival chances  

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **Language:** Python  
- **Environment:** Google Colab  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Dataset:** Titanic dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data)

## 📊 Analyses Performed
- Univariate and multivariate analysis  
- Survival distribution by gender and class  
- Correlation heatmap and pairplots  
- Impact of fare, age, and family size on survival
